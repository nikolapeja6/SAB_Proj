# SAB_Proj
School project for the **SAB** (*Softverski Alati Baza podataka*, en. *Database Software Tools*) course at the [School of Electrical Engineering][1], [University of Belgrade][2].

The goal of the project is to build an information system for package transport. The operations that can be executed on the system are defined by  the interfaces provided with the project statement and described in the [project documentation][3] and the provided javadoc. The database itself is modeled and forward-engineered using the [erwin Data Modeler][4] (these files are placed in the [erwin folder][5]) and the additional stored procedures and triggers are written and placed in appropriate scripts in the [script folder][6]. The database management system used in the project is Microsoft's [SQL Server][7], and so the scripts are written in T-SQL.
